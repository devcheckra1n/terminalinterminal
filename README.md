# terminal in a terminal
I thought this would be funny.
This project is in Python.
the commands are down here

mkdir
: Creates a new directory in the current working directory. The command should be in the format 
mkdir directory_name
.

make
: Creates a new file in the current working directory. The command should be in the format 
make file_name file_content
.

ls
: Lists the contents of the current working directory.

cd
: Changes the current working directory. The command should be in the format 
cd directory_name
 to navigate to a specific directory or 
cd
 to go to the home directory.

The main() function is responsible for the program's main logic. It welcomes the user and prompts for commands in a loop until the user enters exit.

nano
: Open the nano text editor and make changes to text files. Simply enter "nano" as the command and provide the name of the file you want to edit when prompted.

Overall, this code provides a simple simulation of a terminal where users can create directories, files, list directory contents, and navigate through directories.

This emulates your directory using the os library
